87% cheaper than Solidity escrows.
$12 saved per $5K deal = $1,440/year for busy freelancers."

- **Day 3:** Deposit → Release flow working
- **Day 4:** Gas comparison data collected
- **Day 7:** Video recorded
- **Day 10 noon:** Submission completed

**Everything else is negotiable.**

---

## 🛠️ TECH STACK FINAL CHECKLIST

✅ **3 test transactions** completed successfully
✅ **All sponsor integrations** (Alchemy, OZ) visible

---

## 💪 TEAM MORALE RULES

1. **No all-nighters.** 7 hours/day beats 12 hours burned out.
2. **Ship daily.** Something visible every day = momentum.
3. **Celebrate wins.** Deploy contract? Team high-five. Video done? Order pizza.
4. **Cut scope if needed.** Arbiter marketplace nice-to-have? Cut it. Focus on core.
5. **Trust your team.** If Frontend Lead says "UI needs 2 more hours," believe them.

---

## 🔥 FINAL PEP TALK

You have 10 days.
That's 240 hours.
You need maybe 100 hours of focused work.

**You have MORE than enough time.**

The teams that fail hackathons don't fail because of time.
They fail because:
- Scope creep (added NFTs on day 8)
- Poor communication (3 people built the same thing)
- No demo practice (stuttered on stage)

You now have a plan that prevents all of that.

**Follow this sprint. Ship daily. Practice the pitch. You'll win.**

Now go build. 🚀
